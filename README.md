- **File size**
- **Line count**
- **Word count**
- **Character count**

- **`-c`**: Display the file size in bytes (equivalent to `wc -c`).
- **`-l`**: Display the number of lines in the file (equivalent to `wc -l`).
- **`-w`**: Display the number of words in the file (equivalent to `wc -w`).
- **`-m`**: Display the number of characters in the file (equivalent to `wc -m`).
